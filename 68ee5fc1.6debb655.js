You want all the data plotted inside the SVG canvas so it's visible on the web page.\nThe example below sets the x-axis scale for scatter plot data. The ",Object(i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"domain()")," method passes information to the scale about the raw data values for the plot.

It uses the ",Object(i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"max()")," method with a callback function based on the x values in the arrays. The range uses the SVG canvas' width (",Object(i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"w"),"), but it includes some padding, too.
