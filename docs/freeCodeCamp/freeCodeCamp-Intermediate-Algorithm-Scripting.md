## Introduction to the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges

[Intermediate Algorithm Scripting | freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/)

The following challenges are part of FCC's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges. These should prepare you to complete the final challenges for the JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification.

These challenges will allow you to test how much you have learned and which parts you may need to review again before starting the projects.

With that being said-

Have fun and remember to use the [Read-Search-Ask](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck-coding/19514) method if you get stuck.

Good Luck!

## 1. Sum All Numbers in a Range

[Learn Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Sum All Numbers in a Range | freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/sum-all-numbers-in-a-range)

We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first.
For example, `sumAll([4,1])` should return `10` because sum of all the numbers between 1 and 4 (both inclusive) is `10`.

> `sumAll([1, 4])` should return a number.
> `sumAll([1, 4])` should return 10.
> `sumAll([4, 1])` should return 10.
> `sumAll([5, 10])` should return 45.
> `sumAll([10, 5])` should return 45.

```js
function sumAll(arr) {
  return 1;
}

sumAll([1, 4]);
```
